This directory contains the data for the workshop. Please download and copy to your home folder on Sol prior to the workshop. Because the data can be quite large, I subsampled the data to ensure that things run efficiently. However, if you are interested in downloading the complete dataset and running everything on your own, I have included the SRA accession numbers in the complete-data folder.
